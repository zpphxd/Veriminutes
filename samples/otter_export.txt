Speaker 1  0:00
Good morning, everyone. Let's begin our quarterly board meeting. I'm pleased to see everyone here today. We have a full agenda to cover, so let's get started with the roll call.

Speaker 2  0:12
Present and ready. Bob here from the finance team.

Speaker 3  0:18
Carol joining from product development. Ready to go.

Speaker 1  0:24
Excellent. We have a quorum. Today's agenda includes three main items. First, we'll review and approve the minutes from our previous meeting. Second, Bob will present our Q2 financial performance. And third, Carol will discuss the product roadmap for the remainder of the year.

Speaker 2  0:42
Before we start, I'd like to add a quick discussion about our hiring plans under new business, if that's alright.

Speaker 1  0:50
Noted, Bob. We'll add that to new business. Now, let's begin with item one. I move to approve the minutes from our June 15th board meeting as distributed to all members.

Speaker 3  1:03
I'll second that motion.

Speaker 1  1:06
Thank you, Carol. All in favor of approving the June 15th minutes, please say aye.

Speaker 2  1:12
Aye.

Speaker 3  1:13
Aye.

Speaker 1  1:15
Motion carries unanimously. The minutes are approved. Moving on to item two, Bob, please present the Q2 financial report.

Speaker 2  1:25
Thank you. I'm happy to report that Q2 was a strong quarter for us. Revenue came in at $4.2 million, which exceeded our projections by 15%. Our gross margin improved to 72%, up from 68% in Q1. Operating expenses were well controlled at $2.8 million, and we ended the quarter with $12 million in cash reserves.

Speaker 3  1:48
Those are impressive numbers, Bob. What drove the revenue beat?

Speaker 2  1:53
Primarily new enterprise customer acquisitions. We closed eight enterprise deals versus our target of five. The sales team really executed exceptionally well this quarter.

Speaker 1  2:05
That's excellent news. Are there any concerns we should be aware of?

Speaker 2  2:10
Yes, one area to watch is our customer acquisition cost. It's trending higher at $15,000 per enterprise customer, up from $12,000. We need to monitor this closely to ensure sustainable growth.

Speaker 1  2:24
Good point. Let's make that an action item. Bob, can you prepare a CAC reduction strategy for our next meeting?

Speaker 2  2:32
Absolutely. I'll have that ready by October 1st.

Speaker 1  2:36
Perfect. Now let's move to Carol's product roadmap update.

Speaker 3  2:41
Thanks. For Q4, we have three major initiatives planned. First, we're launching our mobile application by November 1st. Second, we're implementing enterprise SSO by November 15th. And third, we're adding real-time collaboration features by December 1st.

Speaker 1  2:58
These are ambitious targets. Do we have sufficient engineering resources?

Speaker 3  3:03
That's actually a concern. We're currently at 80% capacity. To deliver all three initiatives confidently, we'd need to add two to three senior engineers.

Speaker 2  3:14
This ties into my new business item about hiring. I propose we approve hiring three senior engineers immediately.

Speaker 1  3:22
Let's formalize that. I move to authorize the hiring of three senior software engineers with a budget not to exceed $450,000 in annual salaries.

Speaker 3  3:33
I second the motion.

Speaker 1  3:35
Any discussion on the motion?

Speaker 2  3:38
I believe this investment is critical for our Q4 execution and will pay dividends quickly.

Speaker 3  3:44
Agreed. We can't afford to miss these product milestones.

Speaker 1  3:48
Let's vote. All in favor?

Speaker 2  3:51
Aye.

Speaker 3  3:52
Aye.

Speaker 1  3:53
Aye. Motion passes unanimously. Carol, please work with HR to begin the recruiting process immediately.

Speaker 3  4:01
I'll initiate the search this week and have job postings live by Thursday.

Speaker 1  4:06
Excellent. Any other new business?

Speaker 2  4:09
We should schedule our annual strategic planning session. I propose the week of October 15th.

Speaker 1  4:15
Good point. I'll take an action to send out a calendar poll and book a venue.

Speaker 3  4:21
One more item. We need to decide on our board observer policy. We've had requests from two investors.

Speaker 1  4:28
Let's table that for executive session. If there's no other business, I move to adjourn the public portion of this meeting.

Speaker 3  4:36
Second.

Speaker 1  4:38
Meeting adjourned at 10:47 AM. Board members, please stay for executive session.

Speaker 2  4:44
Thank you, everyone.

Speaker 3  4:46
Great meeting. See you next quarter.
